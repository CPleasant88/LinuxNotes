EXT4 - type of file system, VG - volume group, LV - logical volume
Power Supply --> BIOS --> checking the hard drive for the mbr
1024 MB = 1 GB
bit->byte->kilo b->mega b->giga b->tera b->para b
different stages of bits show how much the CPU can relay
software/OS (Operating System) contains a Kernel which in turns acts a middle man to the CPU
GUI = graphical user interface - anything interactive with a computer (mouse, screen, keyboard)
CLI = command line interface - texting
both GUI and CLI interacts with the Kernel; CLI interacts with the Kernal via The Shell
ISO file = image based information from CD/DVD format
thin provisioning - give it via installments; allocates data storage given to use as needed
thick provisioning - give it via bulk which in turn wastes unused data
Naming Scheme = company name.location.function.number
tilde (~) = represents home directory
3 forms of "root"... root=super user; /=file system root; /root=home directory root user
VM Tools help synchronize/manage/communicate the Host with the guest/clients
. = pwd
.. = parent directory
.'filename' -- hidden file
absolute path -- do anything from anywhere...
Run Levels: 0-Shut Down; 1-Single User Mode; 2-Multi User w/no NFS (no networking); 3-Multi User Mode; 4-not used/research; 5-X11 GUI; 6-reboot
/home, /opt and /var will fluctuate with storage
SSHD -- secure shell daemon; runs on port 22
443 -- https; 80 -- http; 20/21 -- FTP
bash -- Bourne Again Shell
3 permission category includes: owner, group and others
pid -- process id
ISP -- Internet Service Provider
OSI model... A.ll P.eople S.eem T.o N.eed D.ata P.rocessing = Application>Presentation>Session>Transport>Network>Data>Physical
routers connect to other networks using packets
switches connect to other networks using frames
demarc zone represents the negotiating field
MAC address -- network hardware

Net Addresses:
      10 -- Class A (Large Business like Amazon); 172 -- Class B (Medium sized business) ; 192 -- Class C (Home Business/Personal)

      Class A, B and C are private I.P. addresses
        Class A Private: 10.0.0.0
        Class B Private: 172.16.0.0
        Class C Private: 192.168.0.0
        Loopback: 127.0.0.0 (checks the internal network stack/checks if your network card is working)

Subnetting helps breakdown a large network by segmenting a large number of I.P. addresses into more manageable smaller networks
      -- each small network can be for departments/devices/VLANs

NAT <-- Network Address Translation
DNS <-- Domain Name Server/Service; name to number service
Local DNS / Internal DNS / External DNS

DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
      uses port 67 to request an I.P. address from a DHCP provider (typically the router or DHCP server on larger networks)

Different DNS Records:
      - A or AAAA
      - CNAME
      - MX

LAN  <=Local Area Network
      - private, internal network

WAN  <=Wide Area Network
      - public, external network

Firewall aka IPTables:
    - Iptables introduced in 2.4 kernel; process to filter network packets as they enter network
    - filter, NAT, mangle, raw, and security are the five tables or rule lists
    - the built in chain for the filter table are:
        - input, output and forward
        - /etc/sysconfig/iptables <-- firewall rules are saved here by default
        - /var/log/messages  <-- firewall logs are saved here

    - CHAIN runs in RAM

NFS: Network File Server

Mounts:
    /etc/mtab <-- display information about manually mounted directories
    /etc/fstab  <-- for automatically mounting, put mount information here


_05.02.2020_

DNS Resolution Process:
1) /etc/hosts <-- local DNS file

2) Internal DNS server (Port 53)

3) External DNS server
    /etc/resolv.conf <-- holds DNS server info

4) Ping the actual I.P. address


* TCP is best described as a 3-Way Handshake

YUM = yellowdog update modifier
    --repositories holds packages
    --Process includes (automatically):
        1) searches repo
        2) loads application and all dependencies
*Must install appropriate repo in order to download appropriate package

RPM = redhat packet manager
    --local packages (applications)
    --packages download directly to system
    --RPM command to install that package
*packages may require dependencies; RPM forces you to find dependencies manually

2 forms of Repo: Internal and External/Public Repo
