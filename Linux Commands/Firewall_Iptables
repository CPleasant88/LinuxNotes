Firewall aka IPTables:
    - Iptables introduced in 2.4 kernel; process to filter network packets as they enter network
    - filter, NAT, mangle, raw, and security are the five tables or rule lists
    - the built in chain for the filter table are:
        - input, output and forward
        - /etc/sysconfig/iptables <-- firewall rules are saved here by default
        - /var/log/messages  <-- firewall logs are saved here

    - CHAIN runs in RAM

Read files in the iptables:
    # iptables -L  <-- list firewall rules in CHAIN
    # iptables -nL  <-- list firewall rules in CHAIN with rule numbers

Modify Contents of iptable:
    # iptables -A
    # iptables -I



Insert iptable rule to top of the CHAIN with -I flag:
    # iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT


Append iptable rule to bottom of the CHAIN with -A flag:
    # iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
    # iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT

Delete line number 0 from the INPUT chain:
    # iptables -D INPUT 0

Flush all iptables rules from chain:
    # iptables -F


    # system-config-firewall  <-- graphical modification tool for firewall/iptables
        * this updates CHAIN and iptables file simultaneously

  Start/Stop/Reload iptable service:
    # service iptables start  <-- start iptables service
    # service iptables restart  <-- restarts service and reloads rules from iptables file into CHAIN
    # service iptables save  <-- saves current rules from CHAIN to iptables file
    # service iptables stop  <-- stops the CHAIN (no firewall)
